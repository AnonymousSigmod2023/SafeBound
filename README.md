__SafeBound__

This repository contains the experimental code for SafeBound, a practical cardinality estimator, as well a comparison method, BayesCard. Further comparison methods will be added soon. The core files are SafeBoundUtils.pyx, Histograms.pyx, and PiecewiseConstantFunctionUtils.pyx.

Instructions for setting up a dev environment and recreating experiments in the paper will be added soon as well.
